                            <p class="sub-title">The computer is an incredibly powerful but mindless machine. One
                                machine can do the work of 50 ordinary men alone but 50 machines cannot do the work of
                                one extraordinary man (Hubbard, Elbert). By learning programming, each of us can become
                                that person who can make this machine speak at will. Programming is simply what you tell
                                the computer to do. Maybe you can say that now the computer does it, when I ask it to
                                play music, it plays it, when I want to play a game, it starts playing with me. But the
                                fact is that a programmer has already told the computer that if you want to listen to
                                music, it should play it. If he kept saying that if you wanted to play games and advise
                                you to sit and read, then the computer would have done that, you would not have had to
                                do anything. A programmer is one whose words make the computer go up and down.
